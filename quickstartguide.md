# B3NCH quick start guide

A few of you have said you're struggling to get started with B3NCH, so while we're dialling our baby in, please use this quick start guide.

**The short short version is load your people and load your skills and then you're good to start creating Briefs and Auctions.**   

Ok so you’ve found B3NCH (not been invited - more on that later) downloaded the app and have logged in. We use 2 factor authentication for added security in exactly the same way as a load of other app’s do.

First let’s start by sharing some of the rules we’ve used when creating the B3NCH app.

A bench is a virtual grouping of people. You can have many benches or just 1 depending on how how you group your people. We suggest starting with 1 and moving from there. The app is designed to be very light-weight and open so it’s pretty flexible.

## BASE RULES
a bench has 3 roles:
* owner
* builder
* resource

### OWNER
* a owner can update all briefs on a bench
* a owner can update all auctions on a bench
* a owner can update all bids on a bench
* a owner can invite resources
* a owner can invite builders
* a owner can update members

### BUILDER
* a builder can update my briefs
* a owner can update my briefs auctions on a bench
* a builder can update my briefs bids on a bench
* a builder can invite resources
* a builder can invite builders
* a builder can update members

### RESOURCE
* a resource selects skills from bench defined list
* a resource has ONE list of skills per bench
* a resource has many skill lists, across many benches

### Next is a quick run through of how to get started

1. You need to create a bench give it a name and your company name - if you are doing this you are the **Owner** of the bench
2. You need to create some members of the bench you can choose to invite them
  * As a **Builder** - think admin or superuser someone who has work to be done (sender) this role is optional - as the owner you can send the Briefs is you want
  * As a **Resource** - someone who wants to do work (reciever)
  * Everyone you invite will get an invite giving them details of how to download the B3nch app and log in
3. You then need to attach skills to your bench - this essentially dictates what type of work will be done
  * For example if you were running a DevOps bench you’d could have things like AWS, Puppet, Ansible, Scripting or Automation
4. **Once you’ve added both members and skills to your bench you are good to start creating and posting Briefs** - a Brief is just a task or piece of work, and can be as short as 1 hour, or last for many years  
5. Start creating Briefs, starting Auctions and realising the value of B3NCH

If you’ve been invited as a **Builder steps 2-5** are relevant for you as well.

If you are an **Owner** or **Builder** and you do most of your work on a laptop or desktop you can use this url https://b3nch-master.platform.b3nch.com . We allow upload of lists of both members or a bench, as well as list of skills, and working with lists is restricted to the browser.

At any point you can chat to us in real time. Just tap the speech bubble in the app, or click Help in the browser and you can ask us any questions you might have.

Thanks
