# B3NCH quick start guide

So, you’ve found B3NCH, (not been invited - more on that later), downloaded the app and logged in. BTW its worth pointing out that we use 2-factor authentication for added security in exactly the same way lots of other app’s do; including most likely your banking app. So everything you do in the app is super secure.

To get started, let’s begin by sharing some of the rules we’ve used when creating the B3NCH app.

The app is designed to be very lightweight and flexible, enabling you to replicate your physical workforce ecosystems in the app. In other words you can replicate your companies actual workforce ecosystem, virtually in the cloud. We can this your very own private human cloud. You can have one bench or many benches depending on how you want to group your workforce ecosystem. Each bench is a virtual representation of your companies physical workforce ecosystem; be-it your internal billable staff, independent contractors or strategic partner resources.

We suggest starting with one bench and building from there.

## BASE RULES
There are three key components that make up B3NCH: Owners, Builders and Workers.

### OWNER
As an Owner, think of yourself as a “Master of Your Entire Workforce Universe”. As an Owner you have full visibility of everything in your worker ecosystem. As an Owner you can:

* Be the Owner and the Builder or just the owner and invite others to be Builders (see below)
* Create, edit and delete as many benches as you so desire
* Create, edit, and delete all/any work orders (briefs) across your benches
* Create, update and run all auctions on your bench(es)
* View and respond to all bids on your bench(es)
* Invite workers to join your bench(es)

### BUILDER
As a Builder, think of yourself as the “Master of a group of workers” with your powers being limited to the bench(es) you have been invited to build.

* A builder can do everything an Owner can but only for bench(es) the Owner has invited you to build
* Oh, and you cannot invite other Builders; only Owners can do that


### WORKER
* A worker can receive briefs, and bid for work opportunities
* A worker can belong to one or many benches, regardless of who the Builder of the bench is

### Next is a quick run through of how to get started

1. First, as an **Owner** enter your company name, create a bench, and give it a name
2. Next invite a **Builder** run your bench or as the **Owner** you can also do that
3. As an Owner or Builder you then need to assign skills to your bench - this essentially dictates what type of work will be auctioned (distributed) to the workers on this bench
  * For example if you were building a bench of DevOps **Workers** you’d could have things like AWS, Puppet, Ansible, Scripting or Automation as the skills for this bench. There is no limit to the number of skills you can assign to a bench
  * We strongly recommend that you build each bench for a very specific group of workers; remembering you can have as many benches as you want
4. Lastly, invite **Workers** to join your bench
 * Everyone you invite to join your bench will get an invite via SMS giving them details of how to download the B3NCH app and log in
  * You can invite workers to join your bench one-by- one or;
   * If you have lots of workers in your ecosystem you can do this using our really cool web browser version which you can find here: https://b3nch-master.platform.b3nch.com
5. As an Owner and/or Builder, you’re now ready to start creating briefs  
 * A brief is simply a task or piece of work, and can be as short as one hour, to many years and everything in between


 So you are now ready to start creating briefs, run auctions, connecting with your workforce and realise the value and power of B3NCH.

 We recommend if you are an **Owner** or **Builder** and you do most of your work on a laptop or desktop you run and manage your workforce ecosystem from the web browser version of the app - URL: https://b3nch-master.platform.b3nch.com

 At any point you can chat to us in real time. Just tap the speech bubble in the app, or click Help in the browser and you can ask us any questions you might have.
