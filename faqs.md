# B3NCH FAQ's

Q: Who is B3NCH for?  
A: B3NCH was built for organisations with a large contingent workforce but anyone can use it whether you are an enterprise with thousands of people or a very small team with only a handful of people.

Q: Why was B3NCH created?  
A: We could talk a lot about the future workforce ecosystem and how this will be managed in the cloud, all of which would be true. But the real reason B3NCH was created was to make sending work to your people easy. No more multiple app’s, conversations, too many people being involved, just an incredibly simple workflow to support you sending work and your people accepting it.


Q: What is the difference between your pricing tiers Self Managed and B3NCH in a Box?  
A: Self Managed means you simply use the B3NCH platform to send work to your people, you can still ask us for help using the software at any point and as B3NCH is a SaaS solution you only need to worry about keeping your mobile app up to date. B3NCH in a Box is our offering where we take care of the offboarding and onboarding of your people. This is carried out by CXC Global, B3NCH is fully integrated with their systems and when you Lock In one of your people, a contract will automatically be sent to them with the necessary dates etc. Currently B3NCH in a Box is only available in the APAC region.

Q: I have both Internal and External people, how would i be charged if i chose B3NCH in a Box?  
A: not sure if we should answer this it might point people away from B3NCH in a box

Q: What is a Locked Worker?  
A: A Locked Worker is 1 of your people being confirmed or Locked in to carry out a Brief for you. So in other words, you will realise value or $ from this.

Q: What is a Bench?  
A: A Bench is simply a logical grouping of your people. A Bench can have as little as 2 Members, 1 Owner and 1 Resource, through to many thousands of Members.

Q: What is an Owner?  
A: An Owner is the person who created the Bench and has ultimate authority.

Q: What is a Builder?  
A: A Builder is essentially a superuser or admin. In your organisation they will be people who organise, find or manage work on your behalf. They can invite other Builders, Resources, add Skills and create Briefs, and Auctions.

Q: What is a Resource?  
A: A Resource is 1 of your people who actually carries out work. They essentially receive the Brief.

Q: What are Sources?  
A: Sources allow you tag and manage your people differently. The Sources are Company Vendor and Supplier. When you’re creating a Brief you can decide to send it to everyone on your Bench, or only those people with a particular Source.

Q: Is it possible to change or amend a Source?  
A: Currently it is not possible to change or amend a Source.

Q: What is a Member?  
A: A member is simply a person on your bench regardless of what Source they have.

Q: What is a Brief?  
A: A Brief is simply a task, contract, or piece of work. We’ve stripped this right back so you only need to enter the absolutely essential information. In your Brief you need to describe what the work is, what skills you need, duration, frequency and you can even add 1 or more locations. B3NCH will calculate most optimal route from the current location.

Q: What is an Auction?  
A: An Auction is how you send or broadcast a Brief to your people. The way to think about this is that you’re essentially asking your people who has both the time and skills to carry out the work you need done.

Q: Do i need to start an Auction to send work to my people?  
A: Yes an Auction is how you ‘broadcast’ or send the Briefs to your people? If you don’t start an Auction your people wont know you need them.

Q: How do i get the best out of my Auctions?  
A: Is you are looking for a large number of skills, its reasonable to assume you’ll only have a small number of people with that skill. And vice versa. So if you’re looking for a lot of skills, create an auction that lasts a long time to allow you’re most skilled guys time to see it and respond. Or if you’re only looking for a couple of skills and you can create a shorter Auction. Remember the number of people with the skills you are looking for will be automatically displayed so you’ll know what you’re theoritical maximum number of responses will be.

Q: All of my guys are internal, do i still need to include rate and ask them to Bid?  
A: Yes, currently the Bid functionality is part of the user journey for all Sources. It is possible to run an Auction with a Rate of $0. We are considering remove this for 1 or more Sources. If you’d like us to add this feature to our product roadmap please let us know?

Q: What information must i include in a Brief?  
A: The only piece of information that IS NOT required is Location

Q: How do i select Skills?  
A: If you are an Owner or Builder you need to load you skills in using the Template we provide. If you are a Resource you will be prompted to choose what skills related to this Bench you have. If a Bench doesn't have/require a particular skill then you cant choose it.

Q: How do i update Skills?  
A: Right now its not possible to update Skills so choose carefully.

Q: How do i know who’s accepted my invite?  
A: If you click/tap on the Members tab this will tell you who you’ve invited and if they’ve accepted or not. This is split by Resource and Builder.

Q: How do i know what role i’ve been invited as?  
A: If you click/tap on the Members tab this will tell you if you’re a Builder. If you can see the Members tab then you’re a Builder, if you cant then you’re a Resource.

Q: Why do i need to invite people with both an email address and phonenumber?  
A: We want you to be confident that B3NCH is secure, the best and easiest way to do that is to have a 2 factor authentication so we can check people are who they say they are.

Q: Who can see the people i put on my bench?  
A: Only you can see the people you invite to your Bench a public search is not, and will never be possible.
