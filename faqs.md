# B3NCH FAQ's

Q: Who is B3NCH for?
A: B3NCH is built for organisations with a large contingent and/or mobile workforce; but anyone can use it whether you are an enterprise with thousands of people or a very small team with only a handful of people.

Q: Why was B3NCH created?   
A: We could talk a lot about the future workforce ecosystem and how this will be managed in the cloud, all of which would be true. But the real reason B3NCH was created was to make sending work to your people easy and in turn significantly reduce the cost of engagement. No more multiple app’s, conversations, too many people being involved, just an incredibly simple workflow to support you sending work and your people accepting it.

Q: What is the difference between your pricing tiers for B3NCH Go! and B3NCH in a Box?   
A: B3NCH Go! is self managed, which basically means you simply use the B3NCH platform to send work to your people, you can still ask us for help using the software at any point and as B3NCH is a SaaS solution you only need to worry about keeping your mobile app up to date. B3NCH in a Box is our managed offering where we take care of the on/off boarding of all your workers who are not employees. Our partner, CXC Global takes care of all of this for you. B3NCH is fully integrated with their systems and when you Lock In a contingent worker, all the documentation to on board them will be automatically generated and sent to them with the necessary project/work order details. Currently B3NCH in a Box is only available in the APAC region.

Q: I have both Internal and External people, how would I be charged if I chose B3NCH in a Box?   
A: You will only be charged for non employee workers ie your contingent workers

Q: What is a Locked Worker?   
A: A Locked Worker is one of your people being confirmed or Locked in to carry out a Brief for you. So in other words, you will realise value or $ from this.

Q: What is a Bench?   
A: A Bench is simply a logical grouping of your workers. A Bench can have one Owner, one Builder and one Worker, through to many Builders and thousands of Workers.

Q: What is an Owner?   
A: Think of an Owner as a “Master of the Entire Workforce Universe”. As an Owner you have full visibility of everything in your worker ecosystem. As an Owner you can be the:
Owner and the Builder or just the owner and invite others to be Builders (see below),
Create, edit and delete as many benches as you so desire;
Create, edit, and delete all/any work orders (briefs) across your benches

Q: What is a Builder?   
A: Think of a Builder as a “Master of a Group of Workers” with their powers being limited to the bench(es) they have been invited to build. A builder can do everything an Owner can but only for bench(es) the Owner has invited you to build. Oh, and you cannot invite other Builders; only Owners can do that.

Q: What is a Worker?   
A: A worker can belong to one or many benches, regardless of who the Builder of the bench is. They can receive briefs, and bid for work opportunities

Q: What are Sources?   
A: Sources allow you tag and manage your workers differently. The Sources are Internal Workers, Partner Workers and Contractors. When you’re creating a Brief you can decide to send it to everyone on your Bench, or only those people with a particular Source.

Q: Is it possible to change or amend a Source?   
A: Currently it is not possible to change or amend a Source.

Q: What is a Brief?   
A: A Brief is simply a task, contract, or piece of work. We’ve stripped this right back so you only need to enter the absolute essential information. In your Brief you need to describe what the work is, what skills you need, duration, frequency and you can even add one or more locations. B3NCH will calculate most optimal route from location to location.

Q: What is an Auction?   
A: An Auction is how you send or broadcast a Brief to your worker ecosystem. The way to think about this is that you’re essentially asking the workers in your ecosystem who have the skills to carry out the work you need done to bid for the work.

Q: Do I need to start an Auction to send work to my people?   
A: Yes an Auction is how you ‘broadcast’ or send the Briefs to your people? If you don’t start an Auction your people wont know you need them.

Q: How do I get the best out of my Auctions?   
A: If you are looking for a large combination of skills, its reasonable to assume you’ll only have a small number of people with that skill. And vice versa. So if you’re looking for a lot of skills, create an auction that lasts a long time to allow you’re most skilled guys time to see it and respond. Or if you’re only looking for a couple of skills you can create a shorter Auction. Remember the number of people with the skills you are looking for will be automatically displayed so you’ll know what you’re theoretical maximum number of responses will be. You can also run multiple auctions for the one brief at the same time. Meaning you can create different skill combinations to cover a wider spectrum of potential workers.

Q: All of my workers are internal, do I still need to include rate and ask them to Bid?   
A: Yes, currently the Bid functionality is part of the user journey for all Sources. It is possible to run an Auction with a Rate of $0. We are considering remove this for one or more Sources. If you’d like us to add this feature to our product roadmap please let us know.

Q: How do I select Skills?   
A: If you are an Owner or Builder you need to determine what skills the workers on your bench need to have.  Then using the Template we provide upload them into the app. If you are a worker you will be prompted when you first log in to select the skills you possess relating to this Bench. If a Bench doesn't have/require a particular skill then you cant choose it; but it also means you don’t need it to be on that bench.

Q: How do I update Skills?   
A: Simply go to the Skills tab and add a new skill.

Q: How do I know who’s accepted my invite?   
A: If you click/tap on the resource tab this will tell you who you’ve invited and if they’ve accepted or not. This is split by Resource (worker) and Builder.

Q: How do I know what role I’ve been invited as?   
A: When in the app if you can see the Members tab then you’re a Builder, if you cant then you’re a worker.

Q: How do I know uninvited workers don’t just join my bench?  
A: We use 2-factor authentication to verify anyone who is logging on to the app.

Q: Who can see the people I put on my bench?   
A: Only you can see the people you invite to your Bench a public search is not, and will never be possible.

Q: I need to get started quickly, how do I do this?   
A: Your best option is to read our Quick Start Guide.

Q: What is your fair go/use policy?   
A: We have deliberately made B3NCH simple with very few constraints to make your life easy, as long as B3NCH is used in the spirit that it was built with, we will be flexible. That said if we believe that you are using B3NCH illegally, maliciously or are abusing our pricing tiers we will remove access.
